    My hobby is reading books. in my spare time i mostly read books and I can finisha book of about 200 pages in 2 or 3 days. My favourite author is Rick Riordan and my favourite series is Percy Jackson. I really love to read books they are my best friends. Books also increase my vocabulary and they help me to be more creative.
